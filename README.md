## Digit Sum Calculation
This program calculates the sum of a number’s digits using both recursive and iterative approaches. It ensures input validity by prompting the user for a non-negative number.

## Puzzle Levels Calculation
Given a number of pieces, this program determines how many levels can be built using both a recursive and an iterative approach. It reduces pieces level by level using a predefined pattern.

## Finding Minimum Difference Between Numbers
This program finds the smallest difference between two numbers in a large array using a brute-force approach and an optimized quicksort-based approach. It compares their execution times.

## Permutation Coefficient Calculation
This program calculates permutation coefficients using three methods: recursion, bottom-up DP, and top-down DP with memoization. It measures execution times for each method.

## Minimum-Cost Path in a Grid
This program finds the path with the lowest cost in an M×N grid using bottom-up DP. It generates a random grid, computes costs, and reconstructs the optimal path.
